This project contains several AI problems


1. Optimisation problem (TSP)

Check the OptimizationProblem.ipynb file for the code that solves the problem, OptimizationProblem.docx complains how the code works.
In this code, I used the two algorithms: The Hill-climbing algorithm and the Simulated annealing algorithm
