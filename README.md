This project contains several AI problems


1. Optimisation problem (TSP)
Check the OptimizationProblem.ipynb file for the code that solves the problem, OptimizationProblem.docx complains about how the code works.
In the code, I used two algorithms: The Hill-climbing algorithm and the Simulated annealing algorithm.

2. Regression problem
Check the RegressionProblem.ipynb file for the code that solves the problem, RegressionProblem.docx complains about how the code works.
In the code, I used 5 algorithms: support vector regression (SVR), linear regression, k-nearest neighbour (KNN), decision tree and random forest.
