This project contains several AI problems


1. Optimisation problem (TSP)

Check the OptimizationProblem.ipynb file for the code that solves the problem, OptimizationProblem.docx complains about how the code works.
In this code, I used two algorithms: The Hill-climbing algorithm and the Simulated annealing algorithm.
